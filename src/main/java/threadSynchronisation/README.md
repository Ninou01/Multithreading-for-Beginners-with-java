# Java Multithreading: Thread Synchronization

This folder contains lessons and examples on thread synchronization in Java. Each file focuses on a specific concept, with detailed explanations and examples.

## Topics Covered

1. **Synchronization Basics** (`SynchronisationDemo.java`)
   - What is `synchronized`?
   - Preventing race conditions.
   - Method-level vs block-level synchronization.

2. **Fine-Grained Locks** (`LockWithCustomObject.java`)
   - Using custom lock objects.
   - Improving concurrency with block-level synchronization.

3. **Producer-Consumer Problem** (`ProducerConsumer.java`)
   - Using `wait()` and `notify()` for thread communication.
   - Solving the producer-consumer problem.

4. **Wait and Notify** (`WaitNotifyDemo.java`)
   - Understanding `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`.
   - When to use `notifyAll()` instead of `notify()`.

## How to Use
- Each file contains detailed comments explaining the concepts and code.
- Run the examples to see how synchronization works in practice.
- Use this as a reference for understanding thread synchronization in Java.
